Data set Description 

What is Pokémon Go? 
Pokémon Go is a free-to-play, location-based augmented reality game developed by Niantic for iOS and Android devices. It was released in July 2016 and in a few selected countries. You can download Pokémon for free of cost and start playing. You can also use PokéCoins to purchase Pokéballs, the in-game item you need to be able to catch Pokémons with. Let us see how to be performing Pokémon data analysis.

Dataset Columns Description: 

The dataset consists of 11 columns and their respective description is as follows:
•	Pokemonid_Number: This column represents the ids of every Pokémon. 
•	Name: This column represents the name of a Pokémon. 
•	Type 1: This column represents the property of a Pokémon.
•	Type 2: This column represents the extended property of the same Pokémon.
•	Total: This column represents the sum of all character points of a Pokémon (Hit Points, attack, defense, special attack, special defense, and speed). 
•	Hit Points (HP): This column represents Pokémon Hit Points, which is a value that determines how much damage a Pokémon can receive. When a Pokémon's HP is down to ‘0’, the Pokémon will faint. HP is the most frequently affected stat of them all, as a depleting HP is a key factor in winning a battle. 
•	Attack: This column represents the Attack stat. 
•	Defense: This column represents the Defense stat. 
•	Special Attack (Sp.Atk): This column represents a Pokémon’s Special Attack stat.
•	Special Defense (Sp. Def): This column represents a Pokémon’s Special Defense stat.
•	Speed: This column represents the speed stat of a Pokémon.


Technologies/Skills required to accomplish the given task 

Big Data Hadoop : in order to pull the data stored in HDFS 
SQL / HIVE : in order to create table , work and Analyze huge amount of datas 
TABLEAU : for Data visualization ,also we should aware of ; how to connect to HIVE tables running on server .
WinSCP : This is FTP client in case we need data to be pulled from your Local/Remote Widows Machines to Your working Unix Based Servers
